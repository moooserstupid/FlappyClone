# FlappyClone
A recreation of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird in C using the raylib library.
Part of a fun series of challenges I set myself to see how fast I could recreate classic games in C. This took about 3 or 4 hours. 
The challenge with this project was getting the bird physics right; unpredictable and fun enough to get people hooked without being too annoying or frustrating.
